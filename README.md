# Python / ImageProcessing

## Open file select (extension type pdf, png, jpg)
=> using MatLab or other libraries rendering them

## Point out where you want extract coordinate
=> Save text file recorded coordinate infos
you can choose additional string tag or variable names ...

## Problem
- We need a precise coordinates like writing signature down in specific position.
- How about transform the image loaded window?
    - Not worked, the image did not move.
- Added helper library: imutils IT IS A LITTERALLY 🐱‍👤SUPER NINZA🐱‍👤 FOR ME.
- Generally using by pip package install path is C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages

## Using imutils
- cv2.EVENT_MOUSEWHEEL makes scroll showing paging another y position
- when image first loaded resize for image size pretty

## Keyboard input
- Q, esc; exit program
- DataType; N: None, D: Data, C: Check, S: Signature
- Later, save module will be added

#### Notice
If you want to make it automatically, build and compile to .exe file 
And execute in server-side


### End of project
- Getting coordinates of image                           => using opencv in python (cv2)
- Handling image pages                                   => using imutils module
- Tracking them with adding, getting, deleting, editing  => using tkinter for UI
- End of project, because of the gap of coordinates between real image and redered image
